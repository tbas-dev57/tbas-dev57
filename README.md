Front-end Project - Liberty

Project made in the scope of the refresher courses taken at IFA of Metz.
The instructions were to recreate a site from scratch.
It was not meant to be reactive but there is extra work on this. Also I
took the freedom to add my own vision to it. There are small changes to
the site.
